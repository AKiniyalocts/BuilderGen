# BuilderGen

## Intro
BuilderGen uses APT and CoreModel to generate builders (following the Builder Pattern) at compile time.

## Steps

* Configure your project to use BuilderGen annotation processing (no doc yet, please look at the example)
* Add @Buildable to any class you wish.
* A builder is automatically created.

## Code example

Suppose you have a Person class :

	@Buildable
	public class Person {
	
	    private final int age;
	    private final String name;
	
	    Person(String name, int age) {
	        this.name = name;
	        this.age = age;
	    }
	    // [...]
	}

BuilderGen generats a PersonBuilder, and you can now do the following : 

    Person person = PersonBuilder.create().name("John Smith").age(42).build();


The generated PersonBuilder has the following code :

	//
	// WARNING : do not edit this file, it has been generated using BuilderGen.
	//
	
	
	package info.piwai.buildergen.bean;
	
	import javax.annotation.Generated;
	import info.piwai.buildergen.api.Builder;
	
	
	/**
	 * Builder for the {@link Person } class.<br />
	 * <br />
	 * This builder implements Joshua Bloch's builder pattern, to let you create {@link Person } instances 
	 * without having to deal with complex constructor parameters.
	 * Furthermore, this builder has a fluid interface, which mean you can chain calls to its methods.<br />
	 * <br />
	 * You may create a new builder by calling the {@link #create()} static method, or this builder's constructor.<br />
	 * <br />
	 * When done with settings fields, you can create {@link Person } instances by calling the {@link #build()} method.Each call will return a new instance.You can call setters multiple times, and use this builder as an object template.
